Covariance Calculation
=========================================

This is a brief document describing where we learn how to access how we can calculate and use the covariance and weight properties of the quadtree. More, detailed information how  ``kite`` calculates the covariance matrix can be found at the module docmentation :mod:`kite.Covariance`.


Accessing the Covariance
------------------------

In this example we will access the covariance attributes of a pre-configured scene.

.. literalinclude :: /examples/scripts/covariance-calculation.py
    :language: python


Graphical Inspection and Manipulation of the Covariance
--------------------------------------------------------
The covariance can be manipulated through ``spool``. More information here :ref:`spool-covariance`.
